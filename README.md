Click on the upper right corner "fork" and fork it to your own repository

Clone that to your local machine

Make a file called what ever you want (in my case it would be abc.txt)

Follow the questions, for example make a variable with your name and print it to the console (this will be longer with the real tests)

Afterwards upload your changes to the repo: git add, git commit, git push it

Make a pull request back to me, so I can see your changes

Finish!
